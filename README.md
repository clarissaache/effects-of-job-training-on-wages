# Effect of Job training on Wages

This analysis investigated the effect of job training for disadvantaged workers on their wages based
on the data from the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration experiment conducted in the
mid-1970s. 

Data for this analysis includes:
* The treatment group (those who received the training) includes male participants within a subset from NSW data for which 1974 earnings can be obtained
* The control group (those who did not receive the training) includes all the unemployed males in 1976 whose income in 1975 was below the poverty level. Not obtained as part of the NSW experiment.

This analysis uses a *multiple linear regression* model to determine if there is evidence that workers who receive job training tend to earn higher wages than workers who do not receive job training.
